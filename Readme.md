## About:
This program was written as a batch file, it would help cleaning the C drive from temporary files.

The file consists of many parts, which are:
- Clean junk files (Ex: files end with .tmp).
- Clean temporary files (Ex: file exist in temp and prefetch).
- Flush DNS cache.
- Use windows cleaner tool (for extra clean).
- Repair system files (as a bonus).

## How to Use:
1- Download the Windows Cleaner.exe file.

2- Run it in administrator mode.

3- Wait till it finish.

## [!Note:]
> For fast cleaning, use "Fast Cleaner.exe" which includes the important cleaning parts only and without the repairing.

> Do not worry its safe to use those files. They only make it easier to remove temporary files and repair the system files to make sure everything is working just fine.

> If you have any problem using exe files then use the bat file instead.
